= Quarkus Antivirus

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

A Quarkus extension that lets you scan files for viruses using a pluggable engine architecture.

Out of the box these engines are supported by this extension:

* https://www.clamav.net/[ClamAV] which is a Linux Native antivirus server
* https://www.virustotal.com/[VirusTotal] which is a REST API to check the Hash of a file to see if it has already been reported for viruses

== Installation

If you want to use this extension, you need to add the `io.quarkiverse.antivirus:quarkus-antivirus` extension first to your build file.

For instance, with Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.antivirus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-antivirus</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Configuration

Now that you configured your POM to use the service, now you need to configure which scanner(s) you want to use in `application.properties`:

=== ClamAV
https://www.clamav.net/[ClamAV] is an open source Linux based virus scanning engine. In development mode a DevService will start a ClamAV instance for you on TCP port 3310, so you can test locally during development.
If you override with your own `host` and `port` the DevService will not start.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.antivirus.clamav.enabled=true
quarkus.antivirus.clamav.health.enabled=true
%prod.quarkus.antivirus.clamav.host=192.168.7.72
%prod.quarkus.antivirus.clamav.port=3310
----

IMPORTANT: If you want to disable ClamAV health check at run-time and not build-time you can use the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.smallrye-health.check."io.quarkiverse.antivirus.runtime.ClamAVHealthCheck".enabled=false
----

=== VirusTotal
https://www.virustotal.com/[VirusTotal] is a REST API that analyses suspicious files to detect malware using over 70 antivirus scanners.  VirusTotal checks the hash of a file to see if it has been scanned and what the results are.  You can set the threshold of how many of the 70+ engines you want to report the file as malicious before you consider it a malicious file using the `minimum-votes` property.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.antivirus.virustotal.enabled=true
quarkus.antivirus.virustotal.key=<YOUR API KEY>
quarkus.antivirus.virustotal.minimum-votes=1
----

== Usage
Simply inject the `Antivirus` service, and it will run the scan against all configured services.  It works against `InputStream` so it can be used in any Quarkus application it is not constrained to REST applications only.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/antivirus")
@ApplicationScoped
public class AntivirusResource {

    @Inject
    Antivirus antivirus;

    @PUT
    @Consumes(MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA)
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Path("/upload")
    public Response upload(@MultipartForm @Valid final UploadRequest fileUploadRequest) {
        final String fileName = fileUploadRequest.getFileName();
        final InputStream data = fileUploadRequest.getData();
        try {
            // copy the stream to make it resettable
            final ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(
                    IOUtils.toBufferedInputStream(data).readAllBytes());

            // scan the file and check the results
            List<AntivirusScanResult> results = antivirus.scan(fileName, inputStream);
            for (AntivirusScanResult result : results) {
                if (result.getStatus() != Response.Status.OK.getStatusCode()) {
                    throw new WebApplicationException(result.getMessage(), result.getStatus());
                }
            }

            // reset the stream
            inputStream.reset();

            // write the file out to disk
            final File tempFile = File.createTempFile("fileName", "tmp");
            IOUtils.copy(inputStream, new FileOutputStream(tempFile));
        } catch (AntivirusException | IOException e) {
            throw new BadRequestException(e);
        }

        return Response.ok().build();
    }
}

== Pluggable
We can't anticipate every antivirus engine out there and some may be proprietary.  However, the architecture is designed to be pluggable, so you can plug your own engine in.  Simply produce a bean that extends the `AntivirusEngine` interface, and it will be picked up and used.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCustomEngine implements AntivirusEngine {

    @Override
    public boolean isEnabled() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public AntivirusScanResult scan(final String filename, final InputStream inputStream) {
        // scan your file here
    }
}
----

== Dev UI
The Dev UI will let you inspect the running ClamAV Dev Service.

You can also inspect the container image that was started under Dev Services:

You can view all of ClamAV's container logs right in the DevUI log.
